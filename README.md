At the moment, the EggCountATT app can only be installed on the Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating systems. To use the EggCountATT app, follow these steps:
1.	Double-click over the installer EggCountATT_Installer/MyAppInstaller_web.exe and follow the instructions.
2.	Type EggCountATT in the search box and click over the app.
3.	In the parameters panel, it is possible to change the parameter values of the app. 
4.	Click over the “Egg Counting in One Image” button to process only one image. First, a dialog window is open to find the input image. Next, the image is processed. EggCountATT returns the output image in the “Output” panel and the egg counting in the table below the button. Additionally, a folder with the name “results” is created to save the output image with the name “EggCountATT_name_of_image.ext” and the egg counting in a text file with the name “EggCountATT_name_of_image.txt.”
5.	Click over the “Egg Counting in a Folder of Images” button to process the images inside a folder. First, a dialog window is open to find the folder. Next, the images are processed one by one. For each image, EggCountATT returns the output image in the “Output” panel and the egg counting in the table below the button. Additionally, a folder with the name “results” is created to save each output image with the name “EggCountATT_name_of_image.ext” and the egg counting of all images in a text file with the name “EggCountATT.txt.”
